# project-theory-solving-mini-clingcon
Project on implementing a minimal version of clingcon using theory solving.

Please update the script `mini-clingcon.py`. 

There are no given tests for this project, but you should at least 
do the tests from the [notebook](https://github.com/potassco-asp-course/notebooks/blob/master/advanced/theory-solving-mini-clingcon/theory-solving-mini-clingcon.ipynb).
